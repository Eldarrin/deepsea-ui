# deepsea-ui
A reactJS &amp; Patternfly 4 expirement for deepsea UI

## Highlights
Totally experimental, learning project for myself to ensure we have a beautiful app.

### Components
ReactJS, with Patternfly4 react

### Business Architecture / UX Principles
The user model behind this is going to be role focused, such as Agent pages, Policy Admin pages, Claim Assessor pages etc.

It will not follow a design paradigm to match the other part of deepsea which is capability focused.

Each user portion will mix and match available capabilities from your build selection. The intention is that this will be dynamic (pick and mix insurance software).
